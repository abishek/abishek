# Abishek Goda

Hey there! While you are here, feel free to look around my repos. A good portion of it is unfinished code ðŸ˜„

## Preferred Programming Languages

- Common Lisp
- Python
- Clojure

## Useless Stuff About Me

- Monkey brained. It's sometimes difficult to follow along - even for myself
- Obsessed with information. Not an info-geek though.
- Hate the news. I've "detoxed" from news over the last few years
- Want to be creative. But my motor functions don't agree. So when I draw, I see art - you'll see scribbles
- Loves earth shades. Hates strong colours
- Mild mannered. Slow to thank, fast to apologise
- My strongest opinion is to not have an opinion. What's true today could very well be taboo tomorrow and probably was yesterday.
